belforeign.1.t:0 "Belgian Proposal!"
belforeign.1.d:0 "We have received an offer from the Belgian government. They are willing to sell us their colonies in Rwanda and Burundi, next to our East African colonies. This is an opportunity to expand our sphere of influence in Africa, and make the British Empire even stronger! However, they have a steep asking price, and their motives are unclear. Nevertheless, we may regret not taking them up on this offer. Especially if another of our competitors takes their offer!"
belforeign.1.a:0 "We are in no need of new colonies right now."
belforeign.1.b:0 "The sun continues to never set!"

belforeign.2.t:0 "Belgian Proposal!"
belforeign.2.d:0 "We have received an offer from the Belgian government. They are willing to sell Eupen-Malmedy back to us for a small fee. Although it is a small area of land, it is historically ours, and populated by Germans. It is still more manpower and more land to build factories and other buildings. We should take this opportunity before they potentially sell to our rivals! "
belforeign.2.a:0 "We have no interest in that speck of land."
belforeign.2.b:0 "Another step towards reuniting Germany!"

belforeign.3.t:0 "Independence!"
belforeign.3.d:0 "After troubled times, our Belgian overlords have elected to cast us off as an unneeded burden to themselves! The Congo is now free from any and all European influence! However, are we even strong enough to maintain our current state without the Europeans?"
belforeign.3.a:0 "No, we need a European overlord to protect us."
belforeign.3.b:0 "Congo for the Congolese!"

belforeign.4.t:0 "Congolese Proposal!"
belforeign.4.d:0 "After troubled times, the Belgians released their colony of the Congo. However, it seems they are uncomfortable taking the reins of their country themselves. However, it seems like another country has also been offered this role. We should split the Congo between ourselves and increase both of our empires."
belforeign.4.a:0 "Yes, split the Congo in half."
belforeign.4.b:0 "No, we are in no need of new colonies right now."

belforeign.5.t:0 "Bad News From Europe!"
belforeign.5.d:0 "Our offer was rejected by both the French and the British."
belforeign.5.a:0 "Damn!"

belnews.1.t:0 "Congolese Independence!"
belnews.1.d:0 "It seems that the Belgians have cut the Congo loose after enduring tough economic times. The country that didn't exist before colonization, is now for the first time self governing."
belnews.1.a:0 "The Belgians had colonies?"
belnews.1.b:0 "Let's see how long that lasts."

belnews.2.t:0 "The Great Depression Hits Belgium!"
belnews.2.d:0 "After the Great War, we were left utterly devestated. No sources of new money have caused much of Belgium to remain in it's war torn state. With the fall of the markets across the west, the Great Depression has hit Belgium. Reconstruction has stopped, our currency is worthless, and it seems that all hope is lost!"
belnews.2.a:0 "God Save Belgium!"

belnews.3.t:0 "The 1932 Elections"
belnews.3.d:0 "Belgium is more politically divided now than ever in our history. We have ideologies of various ranges all around us, and some even more radical than those within our own country itself. Let us hope that the Belgian people choose the correct candidate to lead Belgium into a new age."
belnews.3.a:0 "Begin the elections."

bel.1.t:0 "The Wallonian Vote"
bel.1.d:0 "Wallonia has always been a bastion of liberal ideals. The Liberals and Socialists have always enjoyed rule here. However, could a right wing party sway the liberal stronghold to switch sides? The votes from Wallonia are in. Let's see who won the south."
bel.1.a:0 "The Marxists win Wallonia."
bel.1.b:0 "The Liberals win Wallonia."
bel.1.c:0 "The Conservatives win Wallonia."
bel.1.e:0 "The Royalists win Wallonia."

bel.2.t:0 "The Flemish Vote"
bel.2.d:0 "Flanders has always been a bastion of conservative ideals. The Catholic Party and the Front Party have always had majorities here. However, could a left wing party convince the conservative mainstay to switch sides? The votes from Flanders are in. Let's see who won the north."
bel.2.a:0 "The Marxists wins Flanders."
bel.2.b:0 "The Liberals wins Flanders."
bel.2.c:0 "The Conservatives win Flanders."
bel.2.e:0 "The Royalists win Flanders."

bel.3.t:0 "The German Vote"
bel.3.d:0 "The East Cantons, like Germany itself, is all over the place when it comes to politics. Nevertheless, the prevaling theme is that moderates do well in this region. However, could a left or right wing party convince the moderates to become more radicalized? The votes from the East Cantons are in. Let's see who won the east."
bel.3.a:0 "The Marxists win the East Cantons."
bel.3.b:0 "The Liberals win the East Cantons."
bel.3.c:0 "The Conservatives win the East Cantons."
bel.3.e:0 "The Royalists win the East Cantons."

bel.4.t:0 "Final Tally"
bel.4.d:0 "The entire country's votes are in. It's time to put all the votes together, reject invalid votes, and reject fraud votes. This is a very important election."
bel.4.a:0 "The Marxists win the elections."
bel.4.b:0 "The Liberals win the elections."
bel.4.c:0 "The Conservatives win the elections."
bel.4.e:0 "The Royalists win the elections."

### Focuses ###

BEL_Economy:0 "The Promise"
BEL_Economy_desc:0 "Belgium was scarred by the Great War. Western Flanders was completely destroyed, and parts of Wallonia as well due to the Germans. Reconstruction has not fully completed, and with the onset of the Depression, our people remain without hope that things will get better. We will make them the promise of making Belgium great again."

BEL_Economy2:0 "Finish Great War Reconstruction"
BEL_Economy2_desc:0 "Belgium's infrastructure was left in ruins following the Great War. Repairs began, but were never finished. It's time to get our country back up to modern standards."

BEL_Economy3:0 "Restructure the Ministry of Finance"
BEL_Economy3_desc:0 "Belgium's Ministry of Finance has been in chaos since the beginning of the depression. It's unable to get anything done. Sack the current Minister of Finance and replace him with someone more capable. Restructure the entire ministry."

BEL_Economy4:0 "Construct New Treatise on Belgian Economics"
BEL_Economy4_desc:0 "The economy will need to be drastically restructured to get us out of the depression. We need to rewrite the standard thinking of our current economists, and produce a new Belgian way of thinking."

BEL_Economy1fold:0 "Fold'Em"
BEL_Economy1fold_desc:0 "We've been dealt a bad hand, and we need to cut our losses while we still can. We can't realistically manage an overseas empire while our economy is in the bin. We know when to fold our hand, and we begin with Ruanda-Urundi. Let's sell it to the British."

BEL_Economy1hold:0 "Hold'Em"
BEL_Economy1hold_desc:0 "We've been dealt a bad hand, but with the proper skill and maneuvering, any hand can be a winner. While it is true we need to find new sources of revenue, giving up what we have fought so hard to protect over the years is not the way to do it."

BEL_Economy2fold:0 "Walk Away"
BEL_Economy2fold_desc:0 "The area of Eupen-Malmedy has been in our possession for about a decade now, and yet the people still consider themselves German, and speak only German. Efforts to integrate them into our country have failed and caused a bureaucratic mess trying to accomodate for a country of three peoples instead of only two. We should walk away from this failed mess while we can. Try to sell it to the Germans."

BEL_Economy2hold:0 "Found the Caritas Catholica Belgica"
BEL_Economy2hold_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has always remained wealthy throughout history, and there have always been charitable people within the Catholic community. Thankfully for us, much of Belgium is Catholic. The establishment of this relief service will allow us to retain territorial integrity, and benefit the population. However, establishing this society will cost a small amount."

BEL_Economy3fold:0 "Dismantle the Belgian Empire"
BEL_Economy3fold_desc:0 "Our empire will always remain in our hearts, but it is time to let it go. The cost of maintaining the Congolese colony has grown too great, and we lack the ability to upkeep it. We now only have to worry about our core European territory."

BEL_Economy3hold:0 "Reform the Belgian Franc"
BEL_Economy3hold_desc:0 "The Franc has served as our currency for a hundred years. With the current crisis, we need to reform our currency and peg it to a currency that hasn't been as devalued as ours due to the Depression. This should allow us to begin to get things rolling again economically, but once again will cost us."

BEL_Recov1:0 "Expand The Agricultural Sector"
BEL_Recov1_desc:0 "After cutting costs or getting support for our new programs, we can finally begin them. The agricultural sector has always been a big part of the Belgian economy. We must recover that first before we can move on to the final stages of our recovery."

BEL_Recov2:0 "Expand The Military Industrial Sector"
BEL_Recov2_desc:0 "After cutting costs or getting support for our new programs, we can finally begin them. The military industrial sector has always been a big part of the Belgian economy. We must recover that first before we can move on to the final stages of our recovery."

BEL_RecovEnd:0 "The End of the Depression"
BEL_RecovEnd_desc:0 "After many long days and nights working to reform the Belgian economy, it has finally been done. Our budget is sound again, and our inflation problems have been fixed. Our industry and infrastructure have all been repaired, and the Belgian people are now back to work. The Depression is finally over."

BEL_Political:0 "The 1932 Elections"
BEL_Political_desc:0 "Belgium is more politically divided now than ever in our history. We have ideologies of various ranges all around us, and some even more radical than those within our own country itself. Let us hope that the Belgian people choose the correct candidate to lead Belgium into a new age."

BEL_Walloon:0 "Wallonia Votes"
BEL_Walloon_desc:0 "Wallonia goes to the polls to select the new leaders of Belgium."

BEL_Flanders:0 "Flanders Votes"
BEL_Flanders_desc:0 "Flanders goes to the polls to select the new leaders of Belgium."

BEL_Cantons:0 "Eupen-Malmedy Votes"
BEL_Cantons_desc:0 "The East Cantons go to the polls to select the new leaders of Belgium."

BEL_Electover:0 "End of 1932 Elections"
BEL_Electover_desc:0 "The 1932 Elections have come to an end."

### Ideas ###

BEL_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
BEL_depression_desc:0 "After the Great War, we were left utterly devestated. Following years of slow reconstruction, the Great Depression hit Belgium. Reconstruction has stopped, and Belgium is still half destroyed. Our population is without hope."

BEL_ethnic:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
BEL_ethnic_desc:0 "Belgium is a land of many peoples. In the east are the Germans, in the north are the Dutch Flemish, and in the south are the French Walloons. The tensions and competition between all these minorities are causing major problems trying to create a unified Belgian identity and getting people to work together."

BEL_elections:0 "Elections of 1932"
BEL_ethnic_desc:0 "The elections of 1932 have arrived. A politically divided Belgium should make this years results infinitely more interesting than last years. For better or for worse."
