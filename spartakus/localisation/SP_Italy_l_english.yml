ITA_Red_Decade:0 "The Red Decade"
ITA_Red_Decade_desc:0 "The period known as the ‘Red Decade’ was a series of ideological violence between the left and right of Italy. Starting in 1920, the Red Decade began as a series of anti-war strikes across Italy in protest of the Adriatic War. To counter these protests, members of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana and Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria (Precursors to the PNF), would organize combat divisions to violently put down protestors. Tensions would rise until the end of the Adriatic War in 1921. However, violence still continued and the nation would reach a breaking point in the failed coup d’etat attempted by Benito Mussolini’s Partito Nazionale Fascista in what is now known as the March on Rome in 1923. The King, fearing the past tie Mussolini had to the socialists, would order the army to put down the PNF. Tensions would reach another breaking point in 1928, when then-Prime Minister Luigi Sturzo would be assassinated by a former member of the Camencie Nere before it’s dissolution in 1925. Since that event, the nation has been under a Military Government of “Stability”, however, the situation has just grown worse since."
ITA_Ghastly_Memories:0 "Ghastly Memories of the Great War"
ITA_Ghastly_Memories_desc:0 "We stood victorious with our allies in the Entente over the Central Powers at the end of the Great War. However, our victory came with a cost now considered greater than the reward: Nearly two million Italians dead. There are many who wish to never see such tragedy occur again and are thus hesitant to send our boys off to war once more. It is commonplace for young Italian men to dodge the draft and our leadership considers peaceful approaches, even if through Appeasement."
ITA_Senussi:0 "Senussi Insurgency in Libya!"
ITA_Senussi_desc:0 "Our Possessions in North Africa are constantly being terrorized by members of the Senussi Order. While we had granted them autonomy in 1920, they have rallied several of the various clans in Cyrenaica and Fezzan to their side and have begun a campaign of raids, sabotage and  assassinations. The situation has worsened to the point that the entire region has been put under martial law and governed by the Military. With clouds gathering over the Madrepatria, It is feared that this insurgency will devolve into a full-blown War for independence."
ITA_Army_Sympathies:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Royal Army"
ITA_Army_Sympathies_desc:0 "There are many officers within the Royal Army with ties, current or former, to the Partito Nazionale Fascista. After the failed March on Rome, many of these officers went turncoat at the first sign of opposition to the march by the King. While they declared their loyalty to the king, many in the Stability Cabinet are suspicious of these officers, who have been reportedly indoctrinating troops with fascist ideological thought, purposely allowing fascist violence to occur by delaying troop movements and losing supplies."
