POR_civil_war:0 "Portuguese Civil War"
POR_civil_war_desc:0 "After a disastrous showing in the Great War, Portugal has been plunged into chaos. The humilation of the Republic which had only just been established in 1910 brought about renewed monarchists support in the north. A small rebellion in 1919 made this threat very real, and the subsequent revolutions in Europe intensified the conflicts between the left and right.\n\nBy 1926, the military had enough and attempted a coup, however this failed disastrously due to mass left wing reaction in the south. This just made the situation all that much worse, and by 1931, the people had enough of the liberal republic, overthrowing it in the Rose Revolution. However, it was not long before the predominately conservative and pro monarchist north declared the Republic defunct. Manuel II, the deposed king, returned to Portugal in November to help lead the rebellion, and now, with the new year, hostilities have broken out in full effect.\n\nThis war can only be won by making proper preparations and decisions. We will need §Gweaponry§!, §Yfood§!, §Rmen§! and §Minternational support§!."

### Focus ###
POR_triumphant_republic:0 "The Triumphant Republic"
POR_triumphant_republic_desc:0 "The republic has come close to falling multiple times, and this may have been our greatest threat so far, but we emerged victorious yet again, and we must ensure the republic stays together for good."
POR_integrate_unions:0 "Integrate the Unions"
POR_integrate_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions were a good temporary measure to keep war support up, but with the revolution etablished and the vanguard leading the way, there is no more use for them."
POR_communist_coup:0 "Communist Coup"
POR_communist_coup_desc:0 "Our fellow socialists just didn't understand how the party should function. They did not believe in the true ways of a Vanguard, and now that we have taken power, it is time to establish such a strucure"
POR_collectivization:0 "Collectivization"
POR_collectivization_desc:0 "Our farms shall be reorganized to be under state control in order to set a standard for their efficiency and output. This could cause some other unintended consequences, but it is worth for the revolution, right?"
POR_imprison_agitators:0 "Imprison Agitators"
POR_imprison_agitators_desc:0 "As expected, not everyone is happy about our turn towards more authoritarian ways. Some have protested, others have engaged in more violent methods. Regardless, it shall be declared a crime to engage in such actions."
POR_outlaw_moderates:0 "Crack Down on Moderates"
POR_outlaw_moderates_desc:0 "While moderate elements were certainly helpful in executing the revolution, past events have shown they cannot be trusted in the long term. It would be best to eliminate them before they can organize against us."
POR_mandatory_youth_service:0 "Mandatory Youth Service"
POR_mandatory_youth_service_desc:0 "It isn't enough to simply teach our youths the ways of the revolution. Instead, we must ensure they are disciplined and ready to shed their own blood to secure our safety."
POR_integrate_paramilitaries:0 "Integrate Paramilitaries"
POR_integrate_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Similar to trade unions, the paramilitaries established during the Civil War are no longer of any use, and could ultimately just prove to be a nusiance in the future. It would be best to nationalize them."
POR_purge_traitors:0 "Purge the Traitors"
POR_purge_traitors_desc:0 "Whether it be the moderates, the reactionaries, rebellious socialists or anyone else, anyone who dares stand in the way of our revolution are no better than a common criminal."
POR_ban_republican_parties:0 "Ban Republican Parties"
POR_ban_republican_parties_desc:0 "With our ultimate plans being to establish a Commune, it would make sense to cut down on the amount of supporters of retaining the Republic. It only takes a simple ban."
POR_one_country:0 "One Country, One People"
POR_one_country_desc:0 "It is silly to suggest Portugal is anything but one, united nation with a common goal - the liberation of the working class. There is no need for dividing up the country in the name of 'democracy', as it simply is redundant when considering our end goals."
POR_deploy_police:0 "Deploy Police in the North"
POR_deploy_police_desc:0 "We can not hope to win over the lost souls who dared to support the reactionary rebellion in the north. It would be best to deploy loyal police units who will deal with these threats with any level of force needed."
POR_consolidate_committee:0 "Consolidate the Committee"
POR_consolidate_committee_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Committee was a good temporary measure, but now that the war is over it is time to cut down on its size and power and also populate it with loyal members."
POR_centralized_rulership:0 "Centralised Leadership"
POR_centralized_rulership_desc:0 ""
POR_a_united_commune:0 "A United Commune"
POR_a_united_commune_desc:0 ""

POR_benevolent_revolution:0 "The Benevolent Revolution"
POR_benevolent_revolution_desc:0 "The revolution has succeeded, and the whole of Portugal is now under the new banner of the republic! It will take time to transform the country to our liking, but our path is now secure."
POR_seize_the_gold:0 "Expropriate the Bourgeois Gold"
POR_seize_the_gold_desc:0 "Rather than purge the reactionary capitalists, we will simply take their riches and distribute them among the disgruntled populace. Who knows? Maybe the reactionaries will realize socialism is far superior to their archaic ideologies."
POR_revolutionary_youth:0 "Revolutionary Youth"
POR_revolutionary_youth_desc:0 "Children are the most susceptible to reactionary propaganda. It would be wise to establish a youth program which would teach our youth the ways of the revolution in exchange for enhanced academic and military opportunities."
POR_rewrite_laws:0 "Rewrite the Laws"
POR_rewrite_laws_desc:0 "The old laws of the republic are outdated and do not fit our modern, revolutionary state. It would be best to revise these laws and make the necessary changes."
POR_reconcile_moderates:0 "Reconcile with the Moderates"
POR_reconcile_moderates_desc:0 "Many of those on the moderate wing were content with our rise to power, and although they do not fit well within the revolution, it would be unwise to purge them as some have suggested. Instead, it would be best to reconcile with them to ensure they accept our new society."
POR_revolutionary_propaganda:0 "Revolutionary Propaganda"
POR_revolutionary_propaganda_desc:0 "Some moderate socialists and fringe Leninist elements still doubt the long term success of our form of revolution. Some crafty words and mandated schooling programs would help that."
POR_paramilitary_expansion:0 "Paramilitary Expansion"
POR_paramilitary_expansion_desc:0 "Much of the military unfortunately defected to the monarchy following the revolution, however their archaic ways proved ineffective against the hastily established Republican Brigades. Although some of these brigades will be integrated into the bulk of the army, it would be best to honor these men and women by establishing an official paramilitary."
POR_officialize_committee:0 "Officialize the Committee"
POR_officialize_committees_desc:0 "Although the revolutionary committee was established as a temporary measure to guide our people through troubled times, it has proved to be a proper unifying force. Officializing its structure would be central to completing the revolution."
POR_headless_state:0 "A Headless State"
POR_headless_state_desc:0 "A revolutionary state can not truly label itself revolutionary if it rules through the standard authoritarian ways of reactionaries and capitalists. The revolutionary committee will continue to lead to the country, without a central figure, for our people deserve that at the least."
POR_local_committees:0 "Establish Local Committees"
POR_local_committees_desc:0 "Each administrative region will have its own directly elected committee made of local supporters of the revolution. The government and the party should be a guide for the revolution, not a vanguard."
POR_reconcile_with_north:0 "Reconcile with the North"
POR_reconcile_with_north_desc:0 "Although many in the north supported the failed monarchist revolt, the revolution is forgiving to all who are willing to prove themselves. It would be best to rebuild a nation united, not divided."
POR_codified_decentralization:0 "Codify Decentralisation"
POR_codified_decentralization_desc:0 "It would be silly to return to the old, unfair ways of the monarchy and the failed moderate republic by denying the various regions autonomy. Our country shall be decentralized, and under direct democracy."
POR_outlaw_monarchy:0 "Outlaw the Monarchy"
POR_outlaw_monarchy_desc:0 "In order to ensure monarchist sympathies do not resurface in the north, it would be best to outlaw the return of the monarchy within the new constitution."
POR_a_triumphant_revolution:0 "A Triumphant Revolution"
POR_a_trimphant_revolution_desc:0 "It has taken us many long, hard years to complete the revolution, but our republic is now truly great and united under the common socialist cause."

POR_navy:0 "Marinha Portuguesa"
POR_navy_desc:0 "Many centuries ago we had a navy to be feared by even the greatest world powers. Now, however, our navy is a sad shell of its former self. In this new age of worldwide threats, we should look towards investing in a larger and more modern navy."
POR_1910_naval_plan:0 "Restart the 1910 Naval Plan"
POR_1910_naval_plan_desc:0 "In 1910, the revolutionaries who overthrew the monarchy proposed an ambitious plan to construct three battleships, three cruisers, twelve destroyers and six submarines. Almost nothing came out of this plan, but some have proposed revisiting this plan. We just have to find the funding..."
POR_a_grand_armada:0 "A Grand Armada"
POR_a_grand_armada_desc:0 "Our navy was once great, and it can be great again. The 1910 naval plan will truly produce a modern Armada to be feared by all. We should borrow some ideas from the British naval doctrine."
POR_botafogo:0 "A New Botafogo"
POR_botafogo_desc:0 "In 1534, Portugal produced the largest and most powerful warship of its time, named the São João Baptista, or rather more commonly known as the Botafogo. We should look towards mastering this concept again and applying it to modern battleship designs."
POR_auxiliary_navy:0 "An Auxiliary Navy"
POR_auxiliary_navy_desc:0 "It is silly to think we can ever restore our long lost naval might. It would be best to refit our navy for auxiliary purposes to support our allies without playing a central role."
POR_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Investments"
POR_destroyers_desc:0 "We should invest in destroyer designs to act as screen ships to counter the relatively new combat submarines experienced during the Great War. Our allies would probably appreciate the help."
POR_uboat:0 "Study German U-Boats"
POR_uboat_desc:0 "While it is great to invest in screening ship designs, we can only truly counter submarines by mastering them ourselves. We should study the U-Boats that Germany had during the Great War."
POR_dockyard:0 "Finish the Alfeite Naval Base"
POR_dockyard_desc:0 "We started working on a grand naval base in Alfeite back in 1928, but the Civil War forced the temporary abandonment of the construction. It would be wise to complete the base."

POR_airforce:0 "Força Aérea Portuguesa"
POR_airforce_desc:0 "If the Great War taught us anything, it is that air power can play a decisive role in battle. In the years since the Great War, the capabilities of combat aircraft have only expanded. The next war may very well be decided in the air and we should prepare ourselves."
POR_anti_air:0 "Protecting our Skies"
POR_anti_air_desc:0 "Having an air force isn't always foolproof. We should make sure to establish air defences in our industrial centers to avoid being crippled before we can even put up a fight."
POR_enhanced_plane_production:0 "Efficient Plane Production"
POR_enhanced_plane_production_desc:0 "By using more efficient production methods we can more easily produce aircraft and air defenses. We just might have to do a bit of copying..."
POR_new_air_doctrines:0 "Exploring New Doctrines"
POR_new_air_doctrines_desc:0 "With an air force comes a doctrine. We should explore the many doctrines available to us."
POR_bomber:0 "The Delgado Doctrine"
POR_bomber_desc:0 "The Delgado Doctrine is an ambitious plan presented by Humberto Delgado, one of our most important aerial experts. Delgado believes a fleet of bombers could be used to cripple the ability for the enemy to sustain war."
POR_cas:0 "Battlefield Support Tactics"
POR_cas_desc:0 "In this era, we can now easily drop bombs from aircraft in a much easier and much less dangerous fashion than during the Great War. Small bombers with bombs designed to deal infantry damage are suggested to be employed against our enemy on the battlefield."
POR_strategic_bomber:0 "Terror Bombing"
POR_strategic_bomber_desc:0 "One of the major components of the Delgado Doctrine is to employ large, so called 'strategic' bombers against the main population and industrial centers of our enemies in order to beat down their population to the point where our enemies collapse from within."
POR_all_around:0 "The Beires Doctrine"
POR_all_around_desc:0 "The Beires Doctrine is a plan presented by Sarmento Beires, one of our most important aerial experts. Beires believes a modern, large fleet of fighter aircraft mixed with a moderate amount of multipurpose bomber aircraft would be best for a less industrially relevant country like Portugal."
POR_fighters:0 "A Fleet of Fighters"
POR_fighters_desc:0 "In this new era, bombers are bigger and bolder and cannot easily be shot down from mere rifle fire. In order to protect our skies, Beires suggests that we invest in a fleet of modern fighter planes to crush our enemy before they have the chance to strike."
POR_tactical_bombing:0 "Multipurpose Bombers"
POR_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "One of the components of the Beires Doctrine is to employ lighter, multipurpose bombers which can play a dual role in supporting our men on the battlefield while also being useful for bombing the infrastructure and cities of our enemy."

POR_foreign_workforce_desc:0 "We experienced an unfortunately high amount of unemployment and migration from this Civil War an das a result our workforce has taken a toll.

por.1.t:0 "The Republic of Portugal"
por.1.d:0 "After a disastrous military showing in the Great War and the crushing defeats in Mozambique without any significant territorial gain, the Portuguese Republic was brought to the brink of collapse by 1919. The government had experienced the same humiliation and ineffectiveness that ended the Kingdom of Portugal less than a decade earlier, and it became clear that much of the country had begun to reconsider the Republican Revolution when pro-Monarchist militias seized the north in the first revolt. The army reluctantly put down the rebellion, however many of its leaders were let free because of their status as war heroes and icons. \n\nHowever, with much of Europe succumbing to socialist revolutions in the 1920s, tensions between the far right and far left in Portugal skyrocketed, and the moderate Republican government found itself becoming increasingly alienated among the populace. These tensions continued to boil as the government slowly collapsed and the economy with it. The military attempted to execute a coup in 1926, however the strong left wing supported the Republican government and the coup was only narrowly defeated. The government pursued the conspirators, whom many fled across the border to Spain or to the north where the stronger right wing base sheltered them. Despite the coup being defeated, the Republic continued its downward spiral as moderate leaders found their attempts to keep the left wing coalition which had saved the republic from consolidating power. \n\nThese attempts failed, however, when the Revolução Rosa of October 1931 overthrew the government relatively peacefully in Lisbon, the more rural right wing leaning north was quick to oppose this move, and the city of Porto erupted in a full out rebellion, with barricades being erected on every street manned by man and women alike. However, the government in the south had found other issues, such as an embargo by both Spain and the United Kingdom. This delayed the response to the rebellion in the north, and the rebels declared the republic defunct and illegitimate, proclaiming the Kingdom of Portugal in its place once again. However, the movement was quick to spread across the countryside, and enjoyed the support of its neighbors. British support ensured that the overseas territories of Portugal came under the control of the new monarchy, and Manuel II officially endorsed the revolt in November, returning to Portugal through Spain in November. \n\nIt is now the start of 1932, and the few months of small skirmishes have begun to show cracks as the conflict evolves further into a Civil War. No matter which side emerges victorious, no one can doubt that this period will have a significant impact on the future of Portugal."
por.1.a:0 "Revolução!"

por.2.t:0 "Skirmish at Coimbra"
por.2.d:0 "After months of minor skirmishes that have only ended in stalemate, Monarchist forces have converged on the city of Coimbra near the de facto 'front line'. Although this wouldn't usually be of much concern, thousands of forces have been reported to be moving to reinforce the Monarchist rebels. It is unclear what this will mean."
por.2.a:0 "Push them back!"

por.3.t:0 "The Monarchists Push Back!"
por.3.d:0 "In the largest battle yet of this revolt, Monarchist rebel forces have assaulted Coimbra by the thousands. Although they have been repelled, reports have come in of further skirmishes along the whole line, and it seems likely that this will be the start of full out hostilities."
por.3.a:0 "Now is the time!"

por.4.t:0 "Victory!"
por.4.d:0 "The countryside is devastated, our people lie sick, dying and heartbroken, but it is finally over. The republic has been secured, and the revolution with it. While the times ahead may be even harder, we can only look forwards!"
por.4.a:0 "For the people!"

por.5.t:0 "A Coup Attempt!"
por.5.d:0 "Although the revolution has gloriously succeeded, not all within the Revolutionary Committee agree with the plans ahead. The minority faction, the Portugese Communist Party, has stormed into the building and has attempted to seize power, backed by their paramilitaries."
por.5.a:0 "The Traitors are Slaughtered!"
por.5.b:0 "The Coup Succeeds!"

por.6.t:0 "Communist Takeover"
por.6.d:0 "Following a successful seizure of power, the Portugese Communist Party has been able to use scare tactics to win over the support of much of the Committee. It is seems likely that the party will rule with an iron fist."
por.6.a:0 "Interesting."

por.7.t:0 "The Great Purge"
por.7.d:0 "At exactly 8:27 AM today, the nationalized paramilitaries of the Portugese Communist Party marched into the Committee building in Lisbon and arrested every non-party member, declaring them traitors against the state who would be recieving a trial to determine their fate. These trials are, of course, show trials, and the outcome will be decided by the upper leadership of the PCP."
por.7.a:0 "You cannot run now!"

por.8.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Moderates"
por.8.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the active moderate parties of the PLR, the PRP and the PD were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.8.a:0 "You are all guilty!"
por.8.b:0 "This isn't needed. Move on!"
por.8.c:0 "Uhhh... forget it! All are innocent!"

por.9.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Partido Reformista"
por.9.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Democratic Socialists of the Partido Reformista were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.9.a:0 "Moderates in disguise! Guilty!"
por.9.b:0 "You are wasting my time. Move on!"
por.9.c:0 "The moderates were enough. End this madness!"

por.10.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the Partido Socialista"
por.10.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Revolutionary Socialists of the Partido Socialista were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.10.a:0 "You have too much power! Guilty!"
por.10.b:0 "They aren't the real enemy. Move on!"
por.10.c:0 "The revolution could not have been won without them. End this now!"

por.11.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the P.R.E.D."
por.11.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, all members of the Marxists of the Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.11.a:0 "They are our natural enemies! Guilty!"
por.11.b:0 "They aren't worth the time and effort. Move on!"
por.11.c:0 "They are just like us. End this useless trial!"

por.12.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trial of the 'Disloyals'"
por.12.d:0 "From 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM today, a group of members of our own party who have been considered disloyal without much evidence were put on quick trials who's outcomes were predetermined."
por.12.a:0 "I just know they are plotting something behind my back! Guilty!"
por.12.b:0 "What is this? Prosecuting our own party members? Erase all records of this incident!"

por.13.t:0 "The Great Purge - Trials Completed"
por.13.d:0 "After months of executions, imprisonments, bans and raids the so called 'Great Purge of Portugal' has been completed. The country will need a long time to recover from this."
por.13.a:0 "It was all worth it. Trust me!"

por.14.t:0 "Police Deployment to the North"
por.14.d:0 "It has been some time since the revolution, but various bombings and attacks have dealt major blows to our economy, stability and our population. Giving up power is obviously not an option, and it would be preferable to deploy police to the northern part of our country. The question is, should this be permanent or temporary?"
por.14.a:0 "They will never give up. Deploy indefinitely!"
por.14.b:0 "I am sure a show of force will get them to stop. Half a year and they leave."

por.30.t:0 "Minor Food Shortages Reported"
por.30.d:0 "The Civil War is starting to take a toll on our population. Although the situation is so far relatively minor, there is a number of reported food shortages in the countryside as a result of the economic transition and the isolation we have experienced. This issue is easy to fix, but will require expending resources otherwise used to win the war.\n\nRural civilians are warning us that ignoring this issue as a whole will only hurt us in the long run."
por.30.a:0 "We should take a look at this..."

por.31.t:0 "Escalating Food Shortages Reported"
por.31.d:0 "As a result of not implementing proper measures to halt the food shortage issue, the situation seems to be escalating and spreading to urban areas. This has generated much unrest among a populace that is getting more and more war weary by the minute.\n\nIt is imperative that we implement some measures to halt this immediately before it grows out of control."
por.31.a:0 "Hey, calm down, we'll fix this!"

por.32.t:0 "Major Food Shortages Reported"
por.32.d:0 "Despite major warnings that it was coming, throughout the week major food shortages have been reported across all the territory we control. This was an easily preventable issue but the resources were deemed too valuable to the war effort to spend on preventive measures.\n\nThis has severely undermined our already waning support base and can only be ended with a conclusion to this bloody conflict."
por.32.a:0 "This isn't good..."

por.40.t:0 "Rebuilding the Agricultural Sector"
por.40.d:0 "The Civil War has ravaged the countryside and has severely damaged the ability for our agricultural section to function. The frequent reports of starvations are solid proof of this issue. As part of our duties towards rebuilding from this Civil War, we must immediately decide which agricultural industry to prop up.\nSome are advocating for propping up the vast wheat industry based in Alentejo, while others are suggesting propping up the grape production industry to increase wine exports for greater profits. What will it be?"
por.40.a:0 "The wheat industry could use some help."
por.40.b:0 "Grape production for wine would be the most profitable."

por.41.t:0 "Addressing Wartime Rationing"
por.41.d:0 ""
por.41.a:0 "This is too costly. End the programs."
por.41.b:0 "It may cost us but keeping our people fed is preferable."

por.42.t:0 "Addressing the Economy"
por.42.d:0 ""
por.42.a:0 "Perhaps encouraging a larger female workforce would work."
por.42.b:0 "The demobilized Republican militias can do the job."

por.43.t:0 "Restoring Electricity"
por.43.d:0 ""
por.43.a:0 "Completing the Santa Luzia Dam would boost our power output."
por.43.b:0 "The Tejo Power Plant in Lisbon could use some modernizing."

por.44.t:0 "Tejo Power Plant Expansion Completed"
por.44.d:0 "After a year of expansion on the Tejo Power Plant in Lisbon, the plant is ready to serve our post-war electrical needs for the most part. Although it will not generate as much as the Santa Luzia Dam might have, it was cost efficient and that is all that matters."
por.44.a:0 "Good to hear."

por.45.t:0 "Santa Luzia Dam Completed"
por.45.d:0 "After five long years coupled with an additional two years of surveying before the Civil War, we have managed to finish the Santa Luzia Dam. It is roughly 76 metres tall and 115 metres wide and truly is remarkable achievement for our great people. The hydrodam will be used to produce vast amounts of electricity to help power all of Portugal."
por.45.a:0 "Hurrah!"
